# Desktop Cleaner
 This project will orgonize your dektop files (any path in your system) by its type, date, and name. The code starts to observe the specified path in your system. Whenever the user makes a change in that path, the code checks the changes and moves the added file to another directory and you get a desktop notification for it.
